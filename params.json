{"name":"Tango","tagline":"Download NCBI files and store relevant in local MongoDB database","body":"#Tango\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n##Usage\r\nCollect, store, and retrieve records from NCBI with just the GI number. Uses [NCBI's E-Utilities](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/) interface and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) as a database for local storage.\r\n\r\nThe program will connect and download the file from NCBI corresponding to the GI number(s) provided and the following are extracted and stored in a MongoDB database: GI, accession, sequence, version, locus, organism, sequence length, gene, protein ID, translation.\r\n\r\nThis creates a local database that can be accessed downstream for many applications. Documents can be inserted, updated, read, and removed in order to have the database you wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Options\r\n    -ids            ID(s)\r\n    -file           File with ID(s) [CSV or TXT]\r\n    -db             Database (Nucleotide, protein, etc..) [optional]\r\n    -type           gb, fasta, etc... [optional]\r\n    -force          Force download? [optional]\r\n    -mongo          MongoDB database name\r\n    -collection     Collection name in MongoDB database\r\n    -insert         Insert into database [optional/default]\r\n    -update         Update database\r\n    -read           Read from database\r\n    -remove         Remove from database\r\n    -help           Shows help message\r\n\r\n\r\n###Database Operations\r\n####Insert\r\nTo insert new data (documents) in the database, provide the your GI number(s) with the optional `-insert` flag.\r\n\r\n\ttango.pl -file gis.csv\t\r\n\ttango.pl -file gis.csv -insert \r\n\ttango.pl -id 74960989 4165050 -insert\r\n\r\n####Update\r\nTo update data (documents) stored in the database, provide the `-update` flag followed by your query in format `field:value` you want to update. You will be asked what field you want updated in that document.\r\n\r\nThe following looks for the document with `_id field` matching `34577062`.\r\n\r\n\ttango.pl -update _id:34577062\r\n\t\r\nIt will then tell you which document you are about to update and ask which field you would like to update.\r\n\r\n\tUPDATING _id record [34577062] in database...\r\n\tAvailable fields are:\t_id accession sequence version locus organism seqLength gene proteinID translation\r\n\r\n\tWhat field do you want? sequence\r\n\tWhat is the NEW value for sequence field? NEWSEQUENCE\r\n\r\n####Read\r\nTo read data (documents) stored in the database, provide the `-read` flag followed by your query in format `field:value`. You will be asked what field you want to get from that document and reports back with result.\r\n\r\nThe following reads documents with `_id fields` matching `34577062` and `74960989`. \r\n\r\n\ttango.pl -read _id:34577062 _id:74960989\r\n\r\n\r\n####Remove\r\nTo remove data (documents) stored in the database, provide the `-remove` flag followed by your query in format `field:value` you want removed.\r\n\r\nThe following removes documents with `_id fields` matching `34577062` and `74960989`.\r\n\r\n\ttango.pl -remove _id:34577062 _id:74960989\r\n\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\nYou need to have the following installed:\r\n\r\n1.
